# deploy.sh

This is a simple bash script for deploying projects via scp to remote hosts.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/stefanszymanski/deploy.sh
cd deploy.sh
make install
```

Per default the script is installed in `$HOME/.local/bin`.
If you want it to be installed in another directory use

```
make BINDIR=$HOME/another/directory install
```

There's also a zsh completion script.
The default directory `$HOME/.local/share/zsh/completion` can be changed with `ZSHCOMPDIR`.

```
make install-zsh-completion
# OR
make ZSHCOMPDIR=$HOME/somewhere/else install-zsh-completion
```

  -n            deploy new/untracked files
  -i            do not respect .gitignore

## Deployment

The specified files from the local-dir in the project root are packed into a
gzipped tarball, scp'd to the remote hosts /tmp directory and unpacked to
remote-dir.

## Remote host authentification

Currently only password based authentification is supported. The password is
read from pass (https://www.passwordstore.org).

## Example configuration file

```
[servers]
# <name>  <host>              <auth-type>     <auth-data>
dev       user@host           pass            project/ssh/dev
stage     user@other-host     pass            project/ssh/stage
live      user@example.org    pass            project/ssh/live

[targets]
# <name>  <server>            <local-dir>     <remote-dir>          <post-commands>
dev       dev                 src/public      /var/www/htdocs       rights-plugins
dev2      dev                 src/public      /var/www2/htdocs      rights-plugins
stage     stage               src/public      /var/www/htdocs       rights-plugins;rights-bin

[postcmd:rights-plugins]
# backslashes must be escaped!
find plugins -type d -exec chmod 775 {} \\;
find plugins -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \\;

[postcmd:rights-bin]
find bin -type f -exec chmod +x {} \\;

[default]
# a target name

[branch:master:targets]
# each line is either a target name from section [targets] or target definition
dev
dev2
stage
live      live                src/public      /var/www/htdocs
